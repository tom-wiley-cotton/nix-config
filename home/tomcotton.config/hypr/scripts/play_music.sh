# A TUI to play music.
#
# I wrote this to act as a way to announce my 2024 album Nightfall but got
# incredibly lazy and didn't finish it until a year later :p.
#
# This program was modeled after some GUI programs I have worked on in the past.
# The way it works is that 2 tasks are spawned as background tasks (1
# indefinitely, 1 as needed) and the main thread waits for events from those 2
# background tasks.
#
#                          Main Program
#                        /              \
#                       /                \
#                      /                  \
#         Read Keyboard Events          Play a Single Song
#
# The main program puts itself into an infinite loop where it waits for events
# from both child tasks.  It does this by using a named piped (via `mkfifo`)
# that is created by this script in a temp dir on the filesystem.
#
# The pipe is opened for both reading and writing before any tasks are spawned
# so everything will have access to it.  This allows the "Read Keyboard Events"
# task to block indefinitely until data is read from stdin (the keyboard) and
# also the "Play a Single Song" task to send up information about the underlying
# `ffplay` command, like it's PID when it starts, and its exit code when it
# finishes.
#
# The main process is the only thing that will ever touch the UI - the 2
# background tasks will simply transmit data back up to the main process and the
# main process will handle any and all logic to play music, change the UI, etc.
#
# This program allows the user to pick any song they'd like to play and it'll
# start playing it immediately (killing the previous `ffplay` instance if there
# is one).  If the song finishes the next song will be played automatically
# until the last song of the album is played and finishes.
